<h1><center>My Background</h1></center>
<p><h1> Hello, </p></h1><p><h1>My name is Diamond Toliver. I am currently in my Doctoral program for Information Technology.  When I start something I always finish. I enjoy coding because it's therapeutic. The reason I want to become a software engineer is because I enjoy coding and solving problems. I took a web design class and l really enjoyed it. We used notepad and did a little javascript. Programming is challenging and that is what I love about this field. Technology changes all the time and I enjoy constantly learning new things.</p><h1>
