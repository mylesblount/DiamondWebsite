<h1><center>My Story</h1></center>

<p><h1> Since I was little I loved technology. My first operating system was XP. When I first got my computer I clicked on everything just to see what it does. When I went to highschool I loved drawing and wanted to do graphic design. I took many drawing classes and in my last year in highschool I took a career class. I took a career test and scored high on cyber security. After I graduated I went straight to ITT technical institute. I got my associates in computer networking. Then, I went for my bachelors in information technology and took a web design class and really enjoyed it. My Dean told me I should go for my masters. I got my masters last July and I am currently going to Capella University for Doctoral in information technology. </p></h1>
